Question 1:
Microservice A is dependent on Microservice B which is dependent on Microservice C which is again dependent on Microservice C. Is there any problem with this system? How do we identify faults in this system
 

Issues
--------
Tight Coupling

Difficulty in Testing

Deployment Complexity

Risk of Cascading Failures
If any microservice in the circular dependency chain fails or experiences issues, it can potentially lead to a domino effect, causing failures in other linked microservices.

Solutions:
------------
Dependency Analysis: 
Conduct a thorough analysis of the dependencies among microservices to identify circular chains.

Event-Driven Architecture: Implement an event-driven architecture using publish-subscribe mechanisms to reduce direct dependencies. This way, microservices communicate asynchronously without tight coupling.

Design Patterns: 
Explore design patterns like the #Mediator pattern to centralize communication and reduce direct dependencies between microservices.

Circuit Breaker and Circular Dependencies:

The Circuit Breaker pattern is primarily focused on preventing cascading failures and maintaining system availability when dependent services are experiencing failures. It achieves this by temporarily "opening" the circuit to a failing service and redirecting requests to a fallback mechanism. This helps avoid overloading the failing service and allows the system to gracefully degrade in the presence of issues.
